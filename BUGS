1.  Nested functions should inherit constants from parent scopes, but not
    local variables.  At the moment the former works, but when trying to
    (incorrectly) use a local variable from an outer scope in an inner
    function, the compiler crashes:

        foo :: () {
            x := 42;
            X :: 69;

            bar :: () int { return x; } /* not fine; breaks */
            baz :: () int { return X; } /* totally fine */
        }

    This is presumably due to the compiler maintaining a single tree of
    scopes where a scope contains information for both constants and
    variables.  If this is indeed the cause, then there should most
    probably be separate scope-trees; one which has scopes for constants,
    and one which has scopes for variables.

2.  Recursive functions crash the compiler.

        foo :: () { return foo(); } /* breaks */

3.  Global variables are broken both when being declared and assigned to
    function calls and other globals.  Both of these cased should be
    illegal; globals if assigned at declaration should only be able to be
    assigned to constant expressions.

        foo :: () int { return 42; }
        x := 5;
        x′ := x;     /* breaks */
        x″ := foo(); /* breaks */
